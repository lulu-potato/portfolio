## What this project demonstrates

- Scalable component architecture
- Tokenised styling and theming
- Consistent layout systems
- Motion & transition patterns
- Accessibility-aware markup
- Production-style project structure
- TypeScript in a Vue environment

The goal is not just to make something look good, but to make it **easy to extend and maintain**.

## Tech Stack
